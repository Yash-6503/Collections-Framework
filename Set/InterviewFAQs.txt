Interview Question and Answers of Set Interfaces and its sub classes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1. What is Set Interface?
=> 
- Set is an Interface available under Collection Interface in java.util package from JDK 1.2v
- It does not stores duplicates.
- It does not maintains any order it is unordered.
- Methods of Set interface are not synchronized.
- On Set inteface we can't use ListIterator.
- It stores elements based on Hashing Algorithm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2. What is Hashing Algorithm?
=> 
- It is a technique through which we perform operations like insert, delete, search, etc.
- In this Algorithm we are not using classical index basis approach.
- Hashing Algorith Internally uses HashTable data structure and HashTable Internally uses Bucket
   data structure.
- Here, We perform operation like insert, delete and search with same efficiency that is O(1).
Formula:
---------
    hashvalue = key % HashTable_Length
                67  % 16
                3
        Here, in 3rd position of hash table this 67 element will store.
        Like this it will work for all of other elements.
        If in case, another element whose hashvalue came same as any value present in any position
        then it is called as Hash Collision problem.
        To solve Hash Collision problem we need to use Singly LinkedList.

Q3. What is HashSet?
=>
Method Signature of HashSet class..
public HashSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> implements Set<E>, Serializable, Clonable { }
- HashSet is a sub class of Set Interface available in java.util package from JDK 1.2v
- It is unordered and unsorted set.
- It does not accepts duplicates because Internally equal(Object obj) method is working.
- It accepts hetrogenous and homogenious values.
- It accepts only one null value.
- Methods of HashSet are not synchronized.
- It stores elements by using Hashing Algorithm.
- Initially hash table creates with default capacity of 16 and wiht default load factor of 0.75
- HashSet is mainly used for fast searching.
- It performs constant operations by complexcity of O(1).

Q4. How many Constructors are there in HashSet?
=> 
- There are total 4 Constructors are available in HashSet they are as follows
1. HashSet hs1 = new HashSet();
   Here, it will create a hashSet with default capacity of 16 and load factor of 0.75
2. HashSet hs2 = new HashSet(int initial_capacity);
   Here, it will create a HashSet with user specified capacity and default load factor.
3. HashSet hs3 = new HashSet(int initial_capacity, float load_factor);
   Here, it will create a HashSet with user specified capacity and load factor.
4. HashSet hs4 = new HashSet(Collection c);
   Here, it is to achieve loose coupling i.e (Interconversion of Collection)
